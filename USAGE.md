# openHAB skill for Mycroft

[Mycroft](https://mycroft.ai/) is the worldâ€™s first open source assistant. The skill allows you to connect a running Mycroft 
instance (Mark 1, picroft, etc.) to your openHab. The skill takes advantage of the openHAB REST API, so it works both with the 
v1.x and v2.x, and no openHab upgrade is required. 

The skill is supported for English (U.S.), English (U.K.) languages. 

## General Configuration Instructions

### Requirements

* [A running instance of Mycroft](https://mycroft.ai/get-mycroft/)
* A running instance of openHAB
* openHAB must be reacheable from the Mycroft instance 

### Skill Installation

The openHAB skill has to be installed on you Mycroft instance, please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.mycroft.ai/skills.and.features/adding.skills) 
about how to install a skill. 

Clone the [repository](https://github.com/openhab/openhab-mycroft.git) into your `~/.mycroft/skills` directory.

workon mycroft
cd skill-openhab
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```json
 "openHABSkill": {
        "host": "openHAB server ip",
        "port": "openHAB server port"
      }
```

Restart mycroft for the changes to take effect.
